# Anemia Disease Classification

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify anemia based on patient data. The goal is to develop an accurate predictive model for detecting anemia and assist in early diagnosis.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as:
- Age
- Hemoglobin levels
- Red Blood Cell Count (RBC)
- Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
- Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)
- Other blood-related clinical measurements

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values by appropriate imputation techniques.
- Scaled and normalized the data for better model performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations.
- Used heatmaps to identify patterns and relationships between clinical features.

### 3. Model Building
The following machine learning models were applied:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Cross-validation was used to ensure model generalization.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anemia-disease-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook anemia_disease.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of `X%` (replace with actual value) and provides a robust way to classify anemia patients.
